There was one summer I recall with particular fondness, where my sister and I designed our own clothes out of old drapes and anything else we could get our hands on. She made herself a dress while I fashioned a rough and ready vest. What a hoot! Out of curiosity, if you had to design a piece of clothing for yourself, what would it be and why?

As for materials, something comfy and breathable yet sturdy, maybe good old cotton and some Ankara fabric for added flair. \n\nAs for summer memories, it's gotta be the times my hubs and I used to volunteer at the local orphanage during our holidays.
