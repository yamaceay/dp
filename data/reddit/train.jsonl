More focus on wheat rather than rice. The paneer butter masala and the parathas here... man... \n\nAnd then there's the street food. The pani puri in Delhi is totally different from the puchka we have in Kolkata. Puchka beats out pani puri any day for me though haha! Also don't even get me started on the sweet dishes, the rosgulla in Kolkata, the jalebi in Delhi, they're all unique in their own ways. \n\nSo yeah, just like your Italian Adventure, India also boasts of an extremely rich tapestry of culinary delights.
