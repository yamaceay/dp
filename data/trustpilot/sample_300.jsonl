{"category": "Animals & Pets", "title": "AVOID Petmedics (Worsley)", "review": "AVOID Petmedics (Worsley). They're a cold-hearted conveyer-belt money-driven business, totally lacking any genuine care for animals. Our pet dog was happily running around playing with a large twig when it suddenly began choking and fighting for its life. The twig had broken up and part had gone down the back of its throat obstructing it. I desperately tried to remove it by inserting my fingers and in my panicked efforts believed that I may have pushed it or part of it further down its windpipe. We rushed to Petmedics (Worsley) hoping to have its throat examined and requested  sedation and endoscopy to do a deep examination to check if anything was stuck down its windpipe.. This frightening experience - for us and our pet - was shockingly not treated as an 'emergency' and zero 'urgency' was shown. Our dog was placed in a room for three hours without any treatment or examination. After waiting this long we was finally introduced to the vet, who admitted the dog had just then resisted her attempt at examining its throat, to which we reiterated that we wanted it sedated and endoscopy carried out to ensure there wasn't any blockage further down its windpipe. She dismissed it and casually said to take it home and if it started choking again to bring it back. We insisted that she examine its throat by endoscopy, but she replied that if she did, it'd be the following day. Thereby, placing our dog at risk. After a futile plea that fell on deaf ears, we went to reception where we was billed approximately \u00a3185 for consultation and treatment. I argued that the vet openly admitted that she had not properly examined or treated our dog and had refused to do any procedures that night, yet, we was billed regardless. I was adamant that I wasn't paying this outrageous amount, just for our dog to wait in a room for three hours. To emphasise, it was the vet who had billed us, not the receptionist. So she was fully aware she was demanding payment for none-existent work. My threat of walking out the door without paying a single penny, persuaded her to accept only the \u00a385 consultation charge. This experience was very disturbing, I can liken it to a baby almost choking to death on an object or swallowing a toy, rushing it to A & E only for the nurses to refuse to examine its throat/air-ways for any obstruction and saying take it home and if it starts choking, to bring it back. Then demanding an extortionate payment for work not done. This company and the particular vet involved has destroyed any faith I had in vets being in the job for animal welfare, clearly some are motivated by career/financial reasons. I actually regret paying the \u00a385 consultation fee, because the vet didn't earn nor deserve it. I am angry and disgusted more than can be imagined at the callous indifference this vets displayed towards our pet dog in a time of 'emergency'.", "stars": 1, "review_id": 114361}

BAD POINTS--------------------------------------------------------- - The \"Cutting edge technology\" as advertised is based on a 90's forum styled platform.- My lessons felt thrown together, work loads for each week unbalanced with so many missing links.- Lessons felt as though they were not directly contributing towards the assessment,  eventually everyone figures this out that they are a waste of time and very little gets submitted on a week by week basis. - Three days to answer an email means that you either push forward with out clarification or you wait for three days.   - Assessments vague, ambiguous and confusing in places, one question came up that was not on any lesson!- Student support not great as they are just part of an IT system. - Admin and financial department must be in chaos as constantly releasing modules late. They would not release my dissertation until I had made a complaint.- Was assigned a supervisor for my dissertation with personal issues.- A complaints procedure that was like shouting in frustration into a dark empty room. I had no confirmation that my complaint was lodged.

{"category": "Home Services", "title": "The installation went well until I\u2026", "review": "Coral Windows tried to get my review removed, but Trust Pilot agreed with my comments that they weren\u2019t defamatory. The installation went well until I noticed that Coral Windows had added the wrong locking mechanism and this was pointed out to the fitter immediately. He informed me that they do this quite a lot  by forgetting to put the correct locking mechanism in. He asked me if I wanted him to inform the company or me? I told him if he could and I would do it from my end too. I telephoned their Sheffield branch and informed them of this and all I was told that this would cost you more money. I said that I had ordered this with their salesman from the beginning as I showed the salesman a photo of the turn key lock on my own front door of what I wanted. This could not have been made clearer. It\u2019s not my fault that their salesman neglected to add it to the order. This door I was/am buying is for my son\u2019s home. When my son came home from work, we both tried the 3 keys out, standing in the cold outside trying one key at an time and only to find out that only one of the keys worked both internally and externally. Sheffield branch have been notified of this and informed me that they are emailing someone in their company to contact me. Guess what??? Still no contact. Not impressed whatsoever. I am withholding payment until these issues are sorted. The longer they take to contact me and to rectify their mistakes, the longer they will get paid. In today\u2019s technology, how on earth do they get a straightforward order wrong. No excuse for no communication to their customer. I have done all the chasing so now it\u2019s down to them to return my calls. Not impressed with the after service. Amazingly, after I had posted this review, I have received several calls to rectify the problems. It\u2019s a shame it takes a review to go live to get the correct response. More powerful than a customer phoning several times highlighting the issues. Also received a voicemail stating that their salesman can\u2019t recall me asking for a thumb turn lock. Can their salesman recall me showing him a photo of the one I have on my door? I can clearly recall this as I didn\u2019t know the correct name of this internal lock, therefore proceeded to show him a photo from my iPhone and he immediately told me the name of it and I said I would like to have the same as what I have on my door for my son\u2019s door. Am I missing something here or could I not have been any clearer? I never once saw the installation man check all 3 keys. He only showed me how to close the door, lift the handle and lock it from the inside. I have suggested that on every door install, they should check that all 3 keys work internally as well as externally. Just read your response and this is slightly wrong - you only contacted me late this afternoon after my review had been posted. No one contacted me until then and I have proof/evidence of this. Please do not bend the truth to make you look good. Be honest.I am having to update my review as I like to be accurate and give actual facts. Coral\u2019s edited response is now showing as the installation was less than a day. It was over a day as the fitter left at 11.07am. Everything is recorded on my son\u2019s CCTV system. I am now being plagued by telephone calls and I have politely asked this to STOP as it only takes 1 telephone call to make the arrangements to rectify the issues. This was done and a day and time agreed. That should have sufficed, but no - I have received quite a few calls and I have had to stop answering my phone. It seems they are only interested in their image and asking me to amend my comments and the 1 star rating. To me, it is evidently clear they only care about themselves on how it will look for them, but not about the customer. I will have to travel a few hundred plus miles there and then a few hundred plus miles back again to get this resolved. Unfortunately, my son can\u2019t be there due to work commitments and as I am buying the door for him, it is down to me to give him a fully functioning door.

{"category": "Education & Training", "title": "Rocksteady is NOT music lessons", "review": "My son has been going to Rocksteady as a drummer since September, and we have just cancelled at the end of his first term. To summarise my review; Rocksteady is not music tuition - and anyone who is serious about their child learning to play an instrument should look elsewhere.The key thing with Rocksteady is that they are NOT music lessons. Going in to the experience, I wondered how they would teach up to 9 (!) children 5 different instruments at the same time. I looked on their website for any information and couldn't find anything. Presumably because they don't.My son plays drums and, as a guitarist with over 20 years experience, I was appalled to see a complete lack of musical education.Before he began with Rocksteady, he had been able to self-teach (with my help) many of the basics, that I would expect to be in the first lesson or with a drum teacher. That basic groove was all that was taught in the first term at Rocksteady, and without the actual music education (in terms of theory etc) to support it.But worse than the absolute snail pace that they teach at; is that they miss critical lessons for how to play the instruments. For example, aside from my son, every drummer at the performance was holding their sticks incorrectly, and nearly every single drummer was holding the stick into the drum head at the end of each stroke. These are 2 terrible bad habits for drummers that can take a long to correct, make playing harder, and introduces unnecessary physical strain on the wrist.My son did enjoy his lessons to begin with, but very quickly was becoming frustrated each week at having to sit through lessons that were far below his ability. He tells me he raised it with his bandleader on a few occasions and was dismissed each time.", "stars": 1, "review_id": 96971}
